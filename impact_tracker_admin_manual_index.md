organization. If you have any sub-organizations, they’ll be listed at the bottom of this page.

#### Tips
- Filter the data by date in the top right corner.
- Hover over a Service Category to see total number of hours for that category



## Users

In the Users section, you can invite and manage users. The User Management page shows
basic contact information as well as total service hours each user has contributed to date.

#### Tips
- User Management provides a quick glance at who has or hasn’t logged hours. Sort by
Total Hours by clicking the column title.
- Use the Search box to quickly find a specific user.

<!-- ## Invite Members
You have 3 options to invite users: enter addresses, upload a list, or email them directly.
To Invite Users By Entering Email Addresses
This option is best if you don’t have a lot of email addresses or for one-off invites.
• In Users, go to Invite Users.
• Enter the user’s contact information. If entering multiple email addresses, separate
with a comma.
• Check the Admin box if the new user(s) should be an administrator of the
organization.
• Select Send Invites. When the user creates an account through the link in the email,
he or she will automatically be linked to your organization.

## To Invite Users via List Upload

This option is best if you’re inviting several new users.
• Create a list of email addresses in any spreadsheet program. Note: We do not need
names, and the file type doesn’t matter.
o Indicate if any of the users should be an administrator.
o If you have sub orgs, indicate which users belong to which sub org.
• Email the list to: jacy@mobileserve.org
• The users will receive an email invitation. When they create an account through the
link in the email, they will automatically be linked to your organization.

## To Invite Users Directly

You can bypass the in-app invitations, and simply provide your org code to your users. This
option is best if you want to personalize the email or if you think people may delete (or not
read) an email that comes directly from MobileServe. They can create MobileServe accounts
and add the code during signup or at any point in their Settings.

§ The user will receive an email with a link to the log and the explanation.
§ The user can edit their log and resubmit it for approval again.

## Add Logs on Behalf of Members

Admins can create logs on behalf of an individual, a group, or the entire organization. This
feature is useful when all members participate in a single event or when adding past hours.

clicking the “x” in the top right corner.
o When you’re finished adding users, select the “Bulk Create” button at the
bottom of the page.

## Export Service Logs

Admins can export service log data to a .csv file. The file is emailed to you (it’s sent to the
email address associated with your MobileServe profile).
From the Service Logs page:

• Select the “Export” button in the top right.
o Choose “Selected Logs” in the dropdown.
• To export all logs, select the “Export” button in the top right.

## Photos

Users can include photos when logging their volunteer time, and they have the option to push
them to their social media channels. All photos taken by your members will appear in your
Dashboard in the Photos section, regardless of whether the member posted it elsewhere.
Clicking on any photo will take you to the service log it is attached to, so you can easily read
the story behind the image.
