## What is my Org Code?

The Administrator of your organization’s MobileSere account can provide you with your org code.

## How do I reset my password?

### If you’ve forgotten your password:

  - From the login page, select “Forgot your password?”
  - Enter your email address and you’ll receive a message with instructions to finish the reset process.

### If you can log in but want to change your password:

- Go to your Settings (gear icon), select Change Password.
- If you do not receive an email it’s because the address you entered does not match the email address used to create your MobileServe account. When this happens, email support@mobileserve.org, and we will manually reset your password for you.

## Why do I have multiple accounts?

You may have multiple accounts if you’ve used more than one email address to log in to your account. If you’d like to merge them, email support@mobileserve.org with the following information:

- The email address associated with the account you want to keep (in your Account Settings)
- Whether you want to merge any hours from the account being deleted

## Can I belong to more than one organization?

Yes! You can enter an organization code when creating your account, and you can add or remove organizations at any time in your Settings.

When you belong to multiple organizations and create a log, you can select the organization you want to associate that log with. You can choose multiple organizations, and you can also not check any of them. If you don’t select an organization,, you will receive an alert asking if you’re sure you don’t want to report the time to an organization. Select Continue to move forward.

## How do I add a photo after submitting a log?

At this time, you can only add a photo to a log when you're creating it.

## How do I know if I’m an Administrator of my organization?

If you’re an administrator, you’ll see “Dashboard” as an option in your personal profile menu.

## Who can search for and find me in the MobileServe Find Friends tool?

Your visibility depends on your privacy settings. To view and change your settings:

- Go to your Settings page by clicking on the gear icon.
- Under privacy, you can choose from public, private, or friends only.

## Who do I contact with questions?

Email support@mobileserve.org or use our chat messenger by logging into your account.

## Who has access to my information?

Administrators of your MobileServe account have access to your service logs.
